This article is my attempt of putting together most of the ideas I learned in CPSC 311: Definition of Programming Languages - the most influential course of my undergraduate degree so far. I will attempt to take you through specifying a programming language from the ground up as well as building an interpreter for it in Racket.

First, a little bit about CPSC 311 and why I enjoyed taking it. Working with Racket was amazing - throughout the course, we implemented interpreters for numerous languages, each building upon the other with more complex features. The template driven approach to development (htdp), where the structure of our code followed directly from our data type definitions, made it a lot easier to reason about and debug program. This coupled with the monadic design patterns we used to implement our interpreters lead to really delightful software that I thouroughly enjoyed working with. Ron emphasized how APIs and libraries are really just micro-DSLs in disguise, which allows us to use the learnings from this course in our development endevours.

Alright, let's build a programming language. Meet Ralph, a functional language to which we provide

- Mutable variables (by-reference and by-value)
- First-class (recursive) functions
- Arrays, dictionaries and pairs
- Backstops (more on this later)
- Generalized search
- Exceptions
- Continuations

You can check out the full code at the repository [here](https://github.com/kumarpit/ralph)

Let's start with the basics and define the surface-level syntax for conditionals, functions, identifiers and arithmetic.

```Racket
;; Ralph
;; a toy programming language with
;; - Mutable variables (by-reference and by-value)
;; - First-class (recursive) functions
;; - Arrays, dictionaries and pairs
;; - Backstops (more on this later)
;; - Generalized search
;; - Exceptions
;; - Continuations

;; interp. expressions in a language that supports conditionals, functions and arithmetic
;; Its syntax is defined by the following BNF:
<Ralph> ::=
(ARITHMETIC)
          <num>
        | {+ <Ralph> <Ralph>}
        | {- <Ralph> <Ralph>}
(IDENTIFIERS)
        | {with {<id> <Ralph>} <Ralph>}
        | <id>
(CONDITIONALS)
        | {if0 <Ralph> <Ralph> <Ralph>}
(FUNCTIONS)
        | {<Ralph> <Ralph>}
        | {fun {<id>} <Ralph>}
 where
 {with {x named} body} â‰¡ { {fun {x} body} named}
```

Writing a parser in Racket is straighforward, but before we get started with parsing we need to define a data type for Ralph that our parser will parse to.

```Racket
(define-type Ralph
  [num (n number?)]
  [add (lhs Ralph?) (rhs Ralph?)]
  [sub (lhs Ralph?) (rhs Ralph?)]
  [id (name rid?)]
  [fun (param rid?) (body Ralph?)]
  [app (rator Ralph?) (arg Ralph?)]
  [if0 (predicate Ralph?) (consequent Ralph?) (alternative Ralph?)])
```

Using this definition, we can write the parser.

```Racket
;; the add case
[`{+ ,sexp1 ,sexp2}
       (add (parse/ralph sexp1)
            (parse/ralph sexp2))]
;; the fun case
[`{fun {,x} ,sexp} #:when (rid? x)
                         (fun x (parse/ralph sexp))]
;; and so on...
```

The interpreter looks like this.

```Racket
;; Ralph Env -> Value
;; environment passing interpreter
;; EFFECT: signals an error in case of a runtime error
(define (interp/ralph-env r env)
  (type-case Ralph r
    [num (n) (numV n)]
    [add (l r) (add-value (interp/ralph-env l env)
                          (interp/ralph-env r env))]
    [sub (l r) (sub-value (interp/ralph-env l env)
                          (interp/ralph-env r env))]
    [id (x) (lookup-env env x)]
    [fun (x body) (funV x body env)]
    [app (rator rand) (apply-value (interp/ralph-env rator env)
                                   (interp/ralph-env rand env))]
    [if0 (p c a)
         (if  (zero-value? (interp/ralph-env p env))
              (interp/ralph-env c env)
              (interp/ralph-env a env))]))
```

Before moving on and adding new features, we should prepare our iterpreter for effects - i.e monadify our code.
