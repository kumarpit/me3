This is a record of my week-by-week learnings, experiences and thoughts on my 8 month co-op term at Visier as a Site Reliability Engineer.

## Week 1
The first week was all about getting on-boarded and get set-up. I spent most of my time this week completing HR tasks.

## Week 2
Most of this week was spent going through the developer bootcamp. Since I would be spending a lot of time using Scala, I was required to complete an in-house Scala certification to get used to the language as well functional programming. This meant reading through "Scala for the Impatient" by Cay S. Horstmann. I also picked up "Functional Programming in Scala" by Chiusano and Bjarnason from the internal library - a great read! (you can see my solutions to their exercises [here](https://github.com/kumarpit/scala-exercises)). My first impressions on Scala - I think I am going to enjoy using this language. Having worked with Racket so much in the previous term, it did take some time getting used to writing functional code in Java-like syntax. While going through the certification, there were times where I wished Scala supported dependent types. Also, went out with my team for lunch!

## Week 3
Lots of videos, workshops, and reading. Got assigned my first ticket towards the end of the week. A simple bug fix regarding Consul configurations. Since I wasn't familiar with Consul, I spent some time reading about its uses and applications. In particular, I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3I1kKKfjtQ) video particularly insightful.

## Week 4
Made my first pull request! Worked on diagnosing an issue regarding concurrent JSON deserialization and began work on migrating a table to remove redundant columns. I am slowly getting used to the codebase as well the tech stack and am feeling comfortable. In more personal news, installed NeoVim on both my personal and work machines and have decided to use it as my primary development environment. We'll see how that goes. Refer to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kumarpit/dotfiles) for more on my setup.
